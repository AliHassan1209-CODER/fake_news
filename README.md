The dataset used for training this fake news detection model is too large to upload directly to GitHub.
It has been uploaded as a compressed .zip file named news.zip.

ðŸ”½ How to Use the Dataset:
Download the file news.zip from this repository

Extract (unzip) it using any tool like WinRAR, 7-Zip, or your systemâ€™s built-in unzipper

After extraction, you will get a file like news.csv (or similar)

Place the extracted CSV file in the root directory of the project â€” where files like ai model.ipynb are located
